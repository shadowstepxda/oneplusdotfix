# OnePlus 5/5T DotFix

## Information
This module replaces the necessary camera libraries with modified ones which fix the Dotted Pattern Overlay issue, Front Camera HDR-Enhanced as well as Portrait Mode using the Google Camera Mod on the OnePlus 5/5T. The module will automatically install the correct modified libraries based on the device and Android version detected.

**Note:** The zip will abort the installation if you try to flash it on any other device except the OnePlus 5/5T and if you aren't running Android 7.1-13.0 (API 25-33).
